        <h1>Global Changes in Climate Change Narratives</h1>
        
        <section class="problemdesc">
            <h2>Problem Description</h2>
            <p>For my project, I hope to create an website that <i>displays climate change data</i> 
                and allows users to see news for major cities and watch how these data points change 
                as well as how the overall <i>news narratives changes</i>. Climate change affects all of Earth as it is the overall rising temperature
                of Earth's climate system, as it drives different changes in overall weather. This is an issue as if people do not put forth effort
                to try to fix our issues, it can drive our world to extinction. One major problem that is unaddressed shows the news narratives of climate change,
                especially within our current political landscape, people tend to be in their own bubble of news and do not focus on other opinions. </p>
            <p>Thus, most people who already believed in climate change stayed believing, while others who do not believe in it keep only returning back to news in which agrees with their beliefs.
                I hope to solve this by creating an overall application to showcase not only the change in our Earth's climate, but be able to show how news on climate change has
                changed over time as well as showcasing the difference of narratives in different areas of the world. Other existing solutions to climate change have helped, as the world
                has been changing how they use the climate and reverse, such as wind and solar energy and reducing waste to create a meaningful impact on our world.

            <h2>App Description</h2>
            <p>For my project, I hope to create this app for those interested in climate change and learning more in how it has changed over time. The information that users will see
                will be from external datasets, which are listed below. There are two datasets in which I will be using, one focusing on the direct news narratives while the other showcasing
                the changes in our climate numerically. I hope to combine the two, displaying the numerical weather and climate changes as well as overall top used words in the news articles. I hope 
                to use this app to show how different parts of the world have different narratives on climate change and how that effects the surrounding areas in their climate and temperatures. Overall,
                this solves the problem by showing how different our world is and how our narratives have changed over time and whether or not this helps our world. It gives insight into different ways
                of thinking and how different parts of the world over the past few years have changed how they see climate change. The interactions I would like to include are:
                <ul>
                    <li>Changing displayed data based on years</li>
                    <li>Allowing users to click major cities to see the news articles from those cities</li>
                    <li>Interactions with the map, zooming in and out</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p> The data I hope to use are:
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://blog.gdeltproject.org/a-new-contextual-dataset-for-exploring-climate-change-narratives-6-3m-english-news-urls-with-contextual-snippets-2015-2020/">Climate Change Narratives</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://datahub.io/collections/climate-change"> Climate Change Data</a></li>
                </ul>
